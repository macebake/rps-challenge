Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, Spiderman, Batman, Wizard, Glock (or RPSLSSBWG)

RPSLSSBWG is an expansion on the traditional Rock Paper Scissors game that uses modular arithmetic to determine
the winner. This is a single-player game in which the player battles the computer, which is randomly assigned a
name of one of my pals. :) The game takes place in outer space.
